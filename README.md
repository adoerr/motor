# motor

`motor` (German for 'engine') is a playground for blockchain experiments and exploration based on [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate). Mostly related to block authoring and finalization.

Note that `motor` follows [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) `master`. __However__, instead of Substrate upstream, `motor` follows [this](https://github.com/adoerr/substrate) fork. Reason is that this allows us to follow
`master` closely while still having some sort of well-known version of [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) (current head of the fork).
